# Titanic-Survival-Project
* In this project we would be dealing with the data of the people who boarded the famous Titanic ship which suffered a drastic end because of which many people lost their lives. 
* Our job is to analyse who is more likely to survive from the accident and develop a Machine Learning Model for the same.
* This is a Classification problem since there are only 2 options i.e Survived or Not Survived and since the Output is well defined it falls in Supervised Learning.
* The Dataset is available in the Seaborn Library for the same.
